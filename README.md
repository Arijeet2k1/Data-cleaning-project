Project Summary :- I have a dataset named "smartphones" that is currently complex and difficult to interpret. My aim is to transform this data into 
                   a more accessible format, making it easy to understand and summarize. This will enable meaningful insights to be drawn from the data.

Uploaded Files :-

  FILE 1 - Smartphones_Dirty_Data.csv ( This is the raw data )
           It includes dirty and messy data that needs to be fixed.
  
  FILE 2 - SMARTPHONES_CLEANED.csv ( This is the result of the whole data cleaning process )
           All quality and consistency issues are fixed in this data, and feature engineering is also conducted whenever needed.
  
  FILE 3 - Project_1_SQL.sql ( This file includes all the codes that I have used to clean the data )
           It includes functions like INNER JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, UPDATE, SET operations, subqueries, ALTER TABLE, GROUP BY, and more to manipulate and clean the data.
